1. If you receive a "Download resource" error while installing "i386-elf-gcc", then switch to some other network (preferably to personal hotspot).
2. In case you receive errors related to xcode, then please install the app "xcode" from App Store.
3. If you are still unable to install "i386-elf-gcc", then run the following command on terminal: "brew install i686-elf-binutils i686-elf-gcc". After this installation is complete, replace "i386" by "i686" in line 32 of the Makefile, and rerun "make clean && make && make qemu" on terminal.
